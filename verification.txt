How to verify this library

1. Load the sketch named tests.ino.

2. Connect the device to your compute via a USB cable.

3. Push the firmware to the device. Note that some boards the tests may take more RAM that is available.

4. Run the command "particle serial monitor".

5. Check the output of the serial device for the number of passed tests. 100% of the tests should pass.

NOTE: In this case comment out some of the tests and push the firmware. After a successful run change the commented sections and push the firmware again.
